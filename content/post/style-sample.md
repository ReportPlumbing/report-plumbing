This page serves as a style sample for this site. It contains many common elements, to show how they’re displayed.

This is an introductory paragraph with an [embedded link](/). The magic of hypertext, eh? This document has no intrinsic value, but it’s useful for tweaking the site’s CSS styles.

A lengthy paragraph, with an abundance of text. Useful for checking line-length, and how the text wraps. It’s harder to write these sample paragraphs than an actual article, or indeed the HTML and CSS behind all this. Did you ever think about that? Well, now you have. You’re thinking about it right now. Just use lorem ipsum, you say? I think not.

- A second thing too

Here comes a quotation.

> It has two paragraphs of text, and the second one is long enough to cause line-wrapping.

Another paragraph of text. Our spoken and written languages are surely the crowning achievement of humanity.

Further paragraphs of text. And yet more text. A bit more text too, for good measure.

Here’s a screenshot-type image, with a caption:

Further paragraphs of text. And yet more text, followed by a horizontal rule.
